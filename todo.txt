Some things that are left to do:


- UML Diagram - (In Progress)
- Figma Prototypes - (In Progress)
- User Manual
- Test Record



The application should (minimal requirements):
- Allow stock / inventory control to be maintained
- Allow management to print lists of users and lists of stock
- Allow the addition and removal of users
- Allow management to check overdue accounts
- Allow users to rent and purchase items/service
- Allow users to return rented/purchased items
To achieve a high score, extra functionality and features should be included as you think necessary for your program.
