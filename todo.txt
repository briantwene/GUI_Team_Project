Some things that are left to do:

- UML Diagram - (In Progress)
- Figma Prototypes - (In Progress)
- User Manual
- Test Record

The application should (minimal requirements):
- Allow stock / inventory control to be maintained: (Add / Remove Cars, INSERT * FROM, DELETE)
- Allow management to print lists of users and lists of stock: (Displaying Data, SELECT * FROM)
- Allow the addition and removal of users: (Add / Remove Users, INSERT* FROM, DELETE)
- Allow management to check overdue accounts: (Customer doesn't return car after return date that was stated!)
- Allow users to rent and purchase items/service: (Allow to RENT cars, allow to PURCHASE insurance, which would be our service!) 
- Allow users to return rented/purchased items: (Add cars back to database, INSERT * INTO)
To achieve a high score, extra functionality and features should be included as you think necessary for your program: (Thinking)
